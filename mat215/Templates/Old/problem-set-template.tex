\begin{problem}{7}
	How do we use {\LaTeX} to typeset vectors, or systems of equations?
\end{problem}
%
\begin{solution}
	There a few ways to typeset math. Let's start with a simple vector. For example, we can define a vector in-line by: \verb|\(\vec{v}=\langle \frac{2}{3},-3,1\rangle\)| whose output looks like: \(\vec{v}=\langle \frac{2}{3},-3,1\rangle\), in the same line as the text.
	
	If, instead, we wanted this expression on its own line, we may use the code\\
	\verb|\[\vec{v}=\Big\langle \frac{2}{3},-3,1\Big\rangle\]|\\
	which results in
	\[
	\vec{v}=\Bigg\langle \frac{2}{3},-3,1\Bigg\rangle.
	\]
	
	Alternatively, if we want our equation to be numbered, we can use the \verb|align| environment:
	\begin{align}
		\vec{v}=\Bigg\langle \frac{2}{3},-3,1\Bigg\rangle
	\end{align}
	
	Google is your friend, there are a lot of resources available to help answer questions about \LaTeX.
	
	If we want out vectors to be aligned vertically, we might use the \verb|pmatrix| environment:
	\[
	\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
	\]
	
	The \verb|align| environment is useful when we have equations or computations that span several lines. For example:
	\begin{align}
	2x+3y-z &= 12\\
	x-y-12z &= 0\\
	12x+y+z &= 5
	\end{align}
	The \verb|&| symbol sets an alignment marker. You can mess around with these to arrange the parts of your align environment. You can use the \verb|align*| environment to omit equation numbers:
	\begin{align*}
	2x+3y-z &= 12 & \text{(the first equation)}\\
	x-y-12z &= 0\\
	12x+y+z &= 5
	\end{align*}
	Or, you can use the \verb|\nonumber| command on individual lines to suppress numbering.
	\begin{align}
	2x+3y-z &= 12\\
	x-y-12z &= 0\\
	12x+y+z &= 5 & \text{(the third equation has no number)} \nonumber
	\end{align}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{13}
	What if we want to write a bunch of matrices?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
	There are many variations of the matrix environment, each of which must live inside a math environment such as \verb|\(\)| or \verb|\[\]| or \verb|align|.
	\[
	\begin{matrix}
		\alpha& \beta^{*}\\
		\gamma^{*}& \delta
	\end{matrix}
	\]

	A matrix, in line: \(
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\alpha&     \beta^{*}\\
		\gamma^{*}& \delta
	\end{bmatrix}
	\)

	\[	
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\alpha&     \beta^{*}\\
		\gamma^{*}& \delta
	\end{Bmatrix}
	\]
	
	\[
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\alpha&     \beta^{*}\\
		\gamma^{*}& \delta
	\end{pmatrix}
	\]
	
	\[
	\begin{vmatrix}
		\alpha&     \beta^{*}\\
		\gamma^{*}& \delta
	\end{vmatrix}
	\]
	
	\[
	\begin{Vmatrix}
		\alpha&     \beta^{*}\\
		\gamma^{*}& \delta
	\end{Vmatrix}
	\]
	\[
	\begin{smallmatrix}
		\alpha&     \beta^{*}\\
		\gamma^{*}& \delta
	\end{smallmatrix}
	\]
	
	\begin{align}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\alpha&     \beta^{*} & 7\\
			\gamma^{*}& \delta & -i
		\end{bmatrix}
		\times
		\begin{bmatrix}
		0&1\\
		-1& 1\\
		2 & 4
		\end{bmatrix}
	\end{align}
